# Activity : Can you format this one?

This is a pure fun activity. Actually simple, but you might not get it right - if you don't have your concepts strong.

Display the below paragraph on your browser using text formatting tags.

Don't  be disappointed if you don't get this the very first time. Go back to the previous lecture, watch it once again, try the HTML formatting tags a few more times and then you'll surely get this.

If you still don't, working code is in the folder. Good luck!
