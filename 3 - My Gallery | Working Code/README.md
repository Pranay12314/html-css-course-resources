# Activity : My Gallery

So far we've learned to create a basic HTML skeleton, create headings & paragraphs and add images. It's now time to put this knowledge to use.

Below is a screenshot of the web page you need to create using HTML. It's a small gallery page of 3 albums for your photos. Choose any four photos each for the 3 albums - school days, family time and travel time. You can add a description for each of the albums.
