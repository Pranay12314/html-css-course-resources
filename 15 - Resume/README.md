# Activity : Resume

Here is an interesting activity to help you implement much of your HTML & CSS knowledge - by creating your own resume. This activity also gives you an idea of how some simple styles and right choices of fonts and placement can make a very simple design look beautiful & elegant.

This is the screenshot of the page you need to code:

**Requirements:**

1. Create a page with the same design as above, but use your own name & other information to create your resume.
2. The entire web page uses sans-serif font.
3. Background color of the body is #c9d9cf and background color of the centered block is white.
4. The width of the centered block is 1000px (inclusive of padding). It has a padding of 60px on top and 40px on right, left & bottom.
5. Headings are black. All other content have color #606060.
6. The divider line has a color of #404040, height of 1px & width of 200px.
7. Font size of the name is 72px and the other 4 headings is 24px.
8. Each table cell has a padding of 15px.
9. Paragraphs and list have line height of 1.4
10. Use inline styles wherever necessary, otherwise use internal stylesheet.
11. All the margins which are not mentioned in the above requirements have to be figured out by yourself by looking at the screenshot.

NOTE : Depending on your screen resolution, this page might not fit in one single screen, and you might see a vertical scrollbar - it's perfectly fine.

At the first look of it, you might think this is huge, or be clueless, or find it difficult. Don't worry. This activity doesn't have a demo, but I have attached a set of hints in this folder, to help you complete this on your own. Take your own time to finish - but try your best to do it on your own.

First try this activity, without any hints. If you can't get it, look at the hints.jpg and then at the hints.pdf . Finally, download the working code and compare your code.
