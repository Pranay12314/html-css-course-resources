# Activity : Style your own web page

Use your latest learned knowledge of CSS to style a web page of  your own in your own ways. Use the web page that you created in Section  1, or create a new one. Make sure to do the following:

1. Use some inline styles and some generic styles in the internal stylesheet.

2. Change text colors, sizes and fonts.

3. Set margins / padding between paragraphs.

Go ahead and help yourself learn CSS better. You can ask any doubts in the Youtube video comments. Once you have set a strong foundation with this much, you can learn deeper concepts more easily.
